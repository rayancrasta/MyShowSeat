# MyShowSeat

This project is focused on creating a prototype of a booking service like major cinema and event booking sites like Ticketmaster and BookMyShow. 

The explanation of architecture and implementation of the services and backend technologies is in my [blog on Medium](https://medium.com/@rayancr/building-a-booking-service-backend-like-ticketmaster-and-bookmyshow-using-go-redis-and-postgresql-a4caa1f1105e)

The video demonstration can be seen on Youtube below
