In the provided code snippet:

```go
// signal channel to handle graceful termination in case of interrupts (SIGINT or SIGTERM).
sigchan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigchan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
```

- `sigchan`: This is a channel of type `os.Signal`. Channels in Go are a way for goroutines to communicate with each other. In this case, it is used to receive signals sent to the program, specifically `SIGINT` (interrupt signal, typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` (termination signal, often used for graceful shutdown).

- `make(chan os.Signal, 1)`: This line creates a buffered channel with a capacity of 1. A buffered channel allows one value to be stored in the channel without requiring a corresponding receiver to be ready. In this context, it ensures that the signal handling won't block even if the main routine is not ready to receive the signal immediately.

- `signal.Notify(sigchan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)`: This line registers the channel `sigchan` to receive notifications when the program receives the `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signals. It notifies the channel whenever these signals are caught by the program.

The purpose of this setup is to gracefully handle termination signals. When the program receives a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, the signal will be sent to the `sigchan` channel, and the program will execute the corresponding logic to perform a clean shutdown. In the provided code, this involves closing the Kafka consumer (`consumer.Close()`) before exiting. The `select` statement in the loop continually checks for signals, allowing the program to respond to termination signals without abruptly terminating.

The `select` statement in Go is used for multiplexing operations, allowing a goroutine to wait on multiple communication operations. In the context of the provided code:

```go
select {
    case sig := <-sigchan:
        log.Printf("Caught signal %v: terminating", sig)
        consumer.Close()
        return
    default:
        // Other cases or default logic if no signal received
}
```

- `case sig := <-sigchan:`: This case is executed if there's a signal received on the `sigchan` channel. It's using the channel receive operation (`<-sigchan`) to wait for a value (a signal in this case) from the channel. When a signal is received, the code inside this case block is executed. It logs the caught signal and gracefully terminates by closing the Kafka consumer (`consumer.Close()`) before returning from the `consumeMessages` function.

- `default:`: This block is executed if no signal is received on the `sigchan` channel. In the context of the provided code, it doesn't contain specific logic, but you can use the `default` block to handle other cases or perform default actions when no signal is received.

The `select` statement, in combination with the `sigchan` channel, allows the program to listen for signals while simultaneously processing messages from Kafka. It provides a mechanism to gracefully handle termination signals (`SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`) by closing resources and performing cleanup before exiting the `consumeMessages` function.
